<h1>Python-Website-Blocker</h1>
<hr>
A program that may boost a programmer's productivity by blocking user-specified websites during a certain period of 
time in a day.

# Language
  **Python 3.8.3**
  
# Usage 
  You can either manually run the Python script in your command line(Windows) --> run as administrator for access the permission. My program is intended to be run (be active) all the time.
